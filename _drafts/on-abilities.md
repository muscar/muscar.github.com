In a [post about the core elements of D&D](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ll/20110621), Mike Mearls includes the six well known ability scores as part of the core mechanics:

> The six ability scores—Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma—as the categories for measuring a character’s abilities.

Everyone's so used to them by now that they're set in stone. But are they really primary aspects of a player character (PC) or can they be divided further? Microlite20 (an awesome, awesome game btw) does away with three of them, using [only three core ability scores](http://microlite20.net/m20-core-character-creation/): Strength, Dexterity and Mind. I think that the Mind ability, which consolidates Intelligence and Wisdom, is the key to our problem. Let's look at each ability scores in turn:

* _Strength_ is the brawn of the PC--it's a physical trait;
* _Dexterity_ is the agility of your character--another physical trait;
* _Constitution_ is how well built the PC is, i.e. how much physical punishment he ca sustain before going down--again, a physical trait;
* _Intelligence_ is your character's mental capacity--a mental trait;
* _Wisdom_ is how knowledgeable the PC is--another mental trait;
* _Charisma_ is your character's charm or magnetism--while this is not so clear cut as the others, e.g. you could say that it's a combination of physical and mental traits, I think that the mental aspect is the most important when it comes to charisma;

So we can reduce this to two _core stats_ with _three primary aspects_. The core stats are: Physical and Mind. The primary aspects are: Force, Agility and Lure. Then we can combine them to sort of get the six well known abilities:

        <td>Dexterity</td>
        <td>Intelligence</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Lure</strong></td>
        <td>Attractiveness</td>
        <td>Charisma</td>
    </tr>
</table>
