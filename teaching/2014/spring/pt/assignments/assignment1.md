# Assignment 1 -- Elementary sorts

Pick one of the following assignments:

1. Implement the Shellsort algorithm. Implementat the algorithm such that the
increment sequence is kept in an array, rather than computed.

2. Develop an implementation of insertion sort that eliminates the `j > 0` test
in the inner loop by first putting the smallest item into position.

3. Develop an implementation of insertion sort that moves larger elements to the
right one position with one array access per entry, rather than using `swap()`.

4. Compare the running time of insertion sort with selection sort (and shellsort)
on your computer. Use array sizes that are increasing powers of 2, starting at
128.
