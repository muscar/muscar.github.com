# Programming techniques, Spring 2014

## Resources

### Compilers and IDEs

Depending on your platform you have various options.

#### Windows

You can use [Visual Studio Express](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-desktop).
In order to choose GCC on Windows you can either install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org),
and use your favourite editor---[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) is
a good choice---or you can download [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org)
which comes bundled with its own GCC.

#### OS X

The best choice is [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

#### Linux

You have a wide variety of IDEs. A decent choice is [Eclipse CDT](http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/).
You can also use [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org).

### LaTeX

In order to typeset your documentation you'll need LaTeX system. 

#### Windows

You can use [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/download). You can edit your LaTeX
documents in any text editor, but [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)
has some features that make your life easier.

#### OS X

You can use [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/). It comes with TeXShop, an
editor with a decent set of features to get you started editing LaTeX.

#### Linux

You can use your distro's package manager to install a LaTeX system. You can use
[Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) to edit your LaTeX sources.
