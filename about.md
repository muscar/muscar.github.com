I'm a teaching assistant at the University of Craiova. I'm a language geek---both
programming and natural languages. I'm also into philosophy, reading and the
history of religions. Other cool stuff that I like, in no particular
order: artificial intelligence, literate programming, lisps, functional
programming, type systems, metaprogramming, art and typesetting.
